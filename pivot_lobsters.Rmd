## Read in Data

lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data/lobsters.xlsx"), skip=4)

##Skimr

#One can look at a summary of statistics using summary(); however, it doesn't give a lot of useful information for non-numerical data. We instead use skimr
#skim lets us look more at each variable. We can look at our variables and see that there are 5 unique sites (in the n_unique output). Also, I particularly like looking at missing data. There are 6 missing values in the size_mm variable.

skimr::skim(lobsters)

## Group_by() %>% summarize()
#In R you can create pivot tables by using the above formula. This gives you the functionality of pivot tables in R. Note: The %>% operator is very important. It allows one to combine steps of data cleaning
#data %>% group_by(X) %>% summarize (Y = Z)

lobsters %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_year = n())
  
##What if we want to group by more than one variable? This time let's group by site and year, not just year.

lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear = n())
  
##What is we wanted to summarize multiple varaibles? Say we wanted to calculate the mean and std? Using mean() and sd() we can do that. As well, using the na.rm = TRUE statement allows us to exclude NA data.

lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE))

## Now we want to save this summary information should we want to recall it later.

siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE))

siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()

siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

## a ggplot option:
ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) +  geom_line() 

##To save this use
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))
