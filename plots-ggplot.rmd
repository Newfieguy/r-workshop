# Plots with ggplot2

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)

ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))

## To create a bare-bones ggplot graph, we need to tell R three basic things:
# We’re using ggplot2::ggplot()
# Data we’re using & variables we’re plotting (i.e., what is x and/or y?)
# What type of graph we’re making (the type of geom)

ggplot(data = df_name, aes(x = x_var_name, y = y_var_name)) +
  geom_type()
  
ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y= visitors))+ geom_line()

#you can store the first line as an object. Call it gg_base
#After storing as object, you can change to scatterplot by gg_base+geom_point()

gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))

##We can change the aesthetics of elements in a ggplot graph by adding arguments within the layer where that element is created.
#Some common arguments we’ll use first are:
#color = or colour =: update point or line colors
#fill =: update fill color for objects with areas
#linetype =: update the line type (dashed, long dash, etc.)
#pch =: update the point style
#size =: update the element size (e.g. of points or line thickness)
#alpha =: update element opacity (1 = opaque, 0 = transparent)

gg_base+geom_line(color = "purple", linetype = "dashed")
gg_base+geom_point(color = "purple", pch = 17, size = 4, alpha = 0.5)
gg_base+geom_line(color = "cyan",size = 3, alpha = 0.8)

##When we want to customize a graph element based on a variable’s characteristic or value, add the argument within aes() in the appropriate geom_*() layer

gg_base+geom_point(aes(size = visitors, color = visitors), alpha = 0.5)

gg_base+geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
